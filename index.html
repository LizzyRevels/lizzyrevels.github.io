  <h2>This is not a picture of me. It's a picture of Tampa, Florida where I wish I could be right now.</h2>

  <p>I'm Lizzy. I come from a big family. I have a little family of my own now. I'm pretty quiet.
    Not a big talker. I like being outside, with family and friends, painting, seeing live music.
    I'm from Virginia. I don't know what else to say because I just want to do the assignment.
